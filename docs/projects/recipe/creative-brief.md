# Creative Brief

## Introduction

As a self-initiated project, I am designing a recipe website. Myself having great interest in cooking, I am often frustrated by the bloated, slow, and poorly designed websites. Through this project I aim to research what a recipe page needs to accomplish, and design a website which accomplishes these goals.

I am currently a self-learner of web design and development. At this point I have about two years of learning experience, and I have covered topics ranging from HTML, CSS, Javascript, responsive design, data visualization, React.js, Node and Rails backend development, as well as concepts of UI and UX. My current goals are to practice what I have learned through self-created projects such as this one. I look for problems on the web such as poorly-designed websites or web apps which do not serve the users well, and look to improve them. Ultimately I aim to produce something that people will actually find useful, and begin making real contribution to the world.

## Problems - Solutions

1. Recipe pages are often bloated with ads, internal/external links, and additional sidebar info. This makes the actual recipe content barely readable. SOLUTION: Minimal layout with only contents being something that serves the main Purpose above. Add in links and other info where accessible but not distracting to the main content.

2. Many other recipe pages contain a long blog post about the recipe at the top, making it frustrating when trying to quickly access a recipe. SOLUTION: Place recipe content near the top. Either above the blog post, or have the blog intro paragraph at the top, a recipe card, then rest of the blog post.

## Audience

I believe there are two main types of audiences, depending on the site. Perhaps some websites serve both types.

A. My assumption is that most visitors will come directly from a web search. They are looking for a certain recipe to cook right away. They want to 

	1. Find a recipe that they want to make (Does the dish look enticing?)
	2. Find a list of ingredients so that they can quickly see what they would need to buy in order to make the recipe
	3. Know the time and the process required. Is it something they can or want to handle?

In this case, people want to quickly scan the recipe and determine if they want to make it, and easily follow the recipe if they do make it. It appears that user reviews are a key component of these types of websites. I prefer not to include it to simplify the website, but this needs further considerations.

Examples
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214947/perfect-summer-fruit-salad/
https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/favorite-chicken-potpie/

B. Meanwhile, some recipe websites are more of a personal blog, with a certain theme to the posted recipes. The story behind the recipe, why they made it, are more important. Many users likely have bookmarked the site, and they would browse within the website to find a recipe they like. They are less likely to have a specific recipe in mind, but rather the blog posts will give them the inspirations.

## Website objectives

What objectives should the website serve for the users? This is higher-level objectives. Detailed tasks are in the next section.

## Website features

Details fucntions. User stories

## Navigation Structure

In this case I plan to only design one page. However it may be useful to draw out the entire website structure to give it context.

## Competitor websites

Rough concepts, direction
